This is a work-in-progress of a reimplementation of a system I wrote
almost fifteen years ago to breed genetic algorithms that play the
game of Go.

I've only been hacking on it for a couple days and my Java is rusty so
the code is likely to be gnarly in places.

Note also that so far I've only implemented the basic rules of Go. The
GA part remains to be done.
