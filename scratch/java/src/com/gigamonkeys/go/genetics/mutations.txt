During copying:

  Bit: flip a random bit in a byte

  Byte: replace a byte with a random byte.

  Insertion: insert a random sequence of bytes

  Deletion: delete a random number of bytes.

  Permutation: Replace a sequence of bytes with a random
  permutation. (Specific variants of this include swapping two bytes;
  reversing a sequence of bytes)

After chunking:

  Swap: Swap two not-necessarily consecutive chunks.
